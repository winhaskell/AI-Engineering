Developing the Discipline of AI Engineering

AI Engineering is taking shape as a discipline already across different organizations and institutions. 
We at the SEI see ourselves not only a source of AI Engineering expertise, but also as conveners and catalysts, 
bringing together people and ideas to share the lessons learned, the techniques developed, and the discoveries made.
